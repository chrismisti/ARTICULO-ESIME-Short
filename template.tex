\section{Introduction}

Currently, information security has become a fundamental pillar for the development of reliable digital systems. The increasing sophistication of cyber threats, combined with the exponential growth in data generation and transmission, demands increasingly robust and efficient solutions. In this context, the use of specialized hardware for cryptographic operations has emerged as an effective alternative to the limitations of software-only cryptographic processing.

Cryptographic hardware offers significant advantages, such as higher performance, lower latency, reduced energy consumption, and greater resistance to both physical and logical attacks. These characteristics make it an ideal solution for embedded systems, IoT devices, industrial applications, and environments where security and operational efficiency are top priorities.

Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) have become one of the most versatile technologies for electronic system design. These devices provide a cost-effective solution, especially for low-volume production, since the initial cost of prototyping is considerably lower compared to Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs). Moreover, a key advantage is their reconfigurability during operation, which allows a single device to perform multiple predefined functions, thereby optimizing space and reducing costs.

Today, electronic systems are present in almost every aspect of daily life, from consumer products to industrial control systems, automotive applications, security, and beyond. The current trend in electronic design is characterized by the increasing complexity of components, which demands solutions that are user-friendly, versatile, low-power, and quick to market. Modern integrated circuit technology makes it possible to integrate these complex systems into highly compact dimensions, referred to as embedded systems or Systems on Chip (SoC). These systems, designed to fulfill specific functions, combine hardware and software tailored for each task. In this context, FPGAs, thanks to their reconfigurability, are valuable tools for developing prototypes or small-scale series at affordable costs.

Among the most widely used communication protocols in embedded systems is the Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART), due to its simplicity, low implementation cost, and broad compatibility. However, this protocol lacks native security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to interception, manipulation, and unauthorized access.

This thesis proposes the design and implementation of a cryptographic security layer on top of the UART protocol, using a Register Transfer Level (RTL) approach on an FPGA platform. The implementation leverages a Hardware Description Language (HDL) to model and design digital circuits. The modification of the protocol not only ensures secure data transmission but also integrates encryption and decryption techniques directly into hardware. This solution aims to demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating efficient cryptographic security into embedded communication systems without compromising performance or scalability.

\section{Materials and Methods}
To properly contextualize the present thesis, it is necessary to address the origins of the standard cryptographic algorithm Caesar, as well as its evolution and applications over time. Likewise, the conditions under which information security services and mechanisms emerged will be explored, along with the ways in which they have been implemented across different environments. This analysis allows for the delineation of the problem that this research seeks to address through the proposed hardware-based implementation. Consequently, a review of the state of the art in the field is carried out, with particular emphasis on embedded systems that incorporate security mechanisms.

This review seeks to establish the foundations underlying the design of cryptographic solutions on reconfigurable platforms such as FPGAs, highlighting their relevance in scenarios where information protection is critical. This theoretical framework provides the basis for the methodological and experimental development presented in the following chapters.

\subsection{Classical Cryptography Fundamentals}
Cryptography is the science and art of protecting information through techniques that transform readable data (plaintext) into unintelligible data (ciphertext), so that only authorized individuals can access its content (Stallings, 2017). Throughout history, cryptography has evolved from simple substitution and transposition methods to complex algorithms based on mathematical theory, modern algebra, and number theory.

Although classical methods are now considered insecure against modern attacks, they provide a foundation for understanding fundamental concepts such as key usage, symmetric encryption, and cryptanalysis. One of the most representative algorithms of classical cryptography is the Caesar cipher, also known as the shift cipher.

\subsection{The Caesar Cipher: Historical Background}
The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encrypt military communications. Historical records indicate that Caesar applied a shift of three positions to encode his messages (Kahn, 1996). While its simplicity renders it trivial by modern standards, at the time it provided a basic level of protection against untrained or illiterate readers.

This cipher is classified as a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, in which each letter of the alphabet is systematically replaced by another according to a fixed shift key.
\subsection{Operation of the Algorithm}
From a mathematical perspective, the Caesar cipher can be represented by the following function:
\centerline{\(C(x) = ( x + k ) mod n \)}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
\item $C(x)$ is the encrypted character.
\item $x$ is the index of the character in the alphabet $A = 0, B = 1, \dots, Z = 25$.
\item $k$ is the shift key.
\item $n$ is the total number of characters in the alphabet, usually $n = 26$ for the Latin alphabet.
\end{itemize}

Decryption consists of applying the inverse operation:

\centerline{$P(x) = ( x - k ) \bmod n $}

For example, if the word \textbf{\textit{“HOLA”}} is encrypted with a shift of $k = 3$, the result is \textbf{\textit{“KROD”}}. To decrypt, the inverse shift is applied.

\subsection{Security and Vulnerabilities}

The Caesar cipher is vulnerable to several types of cryptographic attacks:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Brute-force attack:} Since there are only 25 possible keys (excluding the null shift), an attacker can test all combinations in a short time.
\item \textbf{Frequency analysis:} Each language has a characteristic letter distribution. In Spanish, the letters E'', A'', and ''O'' are the most common. If a sufficiently long text is encrypted, these frequencies are preserved, allowing the shift used to be identified.
\end{itemize}

These weaknesses make it unsuitable for any modern application requiring real confidentiality, but it remains useful as a development and educational tool.

\subsection{Usefulness in Cryptographic System Design}

Despite its limitations, the Caesar cipher is frequently used in the design of hardware/software cryptographic systems for educational and experimental purposes. Its simple structure makes it an ideal choice for:

\begin{itemize}
\item Introducing sequential data processing techniques.
\item Implementing finite state machines for encoding and decoding.
\item Evaluating logical resource usage and propagation delays on platforms such as FPGAs.
\item Comparing the behavior of more complex ciphers with respect to basic algorithms in low-level environments (VHDL, Verilog).
\end{itemize}

In digital design projects with RTL (Register Transfer Level) architecture, the Caesar cipher is used as a case study to optimize modular shift operations, ASCII character encoding, and key generation.



\subsection{Background on SystemVerilog}

\subsection{Evolution of Digital Design and the Emergence of SystemVerilog}

The development of digital design has undergone significant transformations since its inception, beginning with physical prototyping using breadboards and evolving to sophisticated computer-aided simulation and modeling platforms. CAD (Computer-Aided Design) tools allowed for more precise and efficient simulation of electronic circuits, although their initial use required overcoming certain technical complexity barriers.

These tools facilitated the implementation of electrical schematics and enabled the definition of input signals consistent with system logic, producing outputs that were easily interpretable. Simulators such as SPICE became benchmarks in both academic and industrial settings by providing accurate modeling of electrical behavior. Once results were validated, the physical circuit design was carried out using specialized printed circuit board (PCB) tools, such as the OrCAD environment, particularly its PCB Layout module.

During this stage, the Adaptable Computing Laboratory began implementing electronic neural circuit models using these platforms (Padrón, 1997). Later, as the complexity of neural network models increased, tools such as MATLAB and its graphical environment SIMULINK were incorporated, allowing a direct mathematical representation of dynamic systems. This evolution enabled more effective interpretation of results, both quantitatively and qualitatively (Padrón et al., 2000, pp. 338–349).

In parallel, the reconfigurable hardware industry, particularly through FPGA boards manufactured by Xilinx, allowed addressing specific problems via programmable interfaces. Each board is designed to offer flexibility to the user, who can program its components in hardware description languages such as Verilog or VHDL and integrate various interfaces depending on the physical or logical availability of the system. This versatility made development kits fundamental tools for designing custom solutions, especially in rapid prototyping and functional validation contexts.

As system-level design requirements grew and verification became a critical stage, SystemVerilog emerged as an extension and evolution of the Verilog language. SystemVerilog not only incorporated improvements in structural and behavioral hardware description but also integrated capabilities for functional verification, object-oriented programming, and complex system modeling. This evolution addressed the need to unify the design and verification flow under a single language, facilitating the implementation of advanced testbenches, reusable interfaces, and verification environments compatible with modern methodologies such as UVM (Universal Verification Methodology).

In this regard, the use of FPGA boards programmed with SystemVerilog allows combining the precision of RTL design with advanced verification capabilities, which is essential in development environments aiming to ensure functionality, performance, and reliability from the early stages of a project. The history and evolution of this language reflect a trend toward consolidating tools that integrate design, simulation, verification, and synthesis within a single development environment.

\textbf{Relevant chronology of SystemVerilog development:}
\begin{itemize}
\item 1984: The Verilog language is introduced as a hardware description tool by Gateway Design Automation, later acquired by Cadence (IEEE, 2008).
\item 1990s: Verilog becomes one of the main standards for digital design, widely used in the electronics industry.
\item 1999: Development of SystemVerilog begins as an extension of Verilog to address limitations in verification and modeling (Accellera Systems Initiative, 2002).
\item 2002: SystemVerilog is formally adopted by Accellera as a standard for design and verification.
\item 2005: SystemVerilog is standardized by IEEE as IEEE 1800-2005, consolidating its industrial use (IEEE, 2005).
\item 2012: The IEEE 1800-2012 revision is published, incorporating improvements in synthesis and verification.
\item 2017: The IEEE 1800-2017 revision is published, expanding features for complex system design and verification.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hardware Description Languages (HDL) and Their Application in Digital Design}

Hardware Description Languages (HDL) emerged in response to the need for digital designers to have formal tools that allow the specification, modeling, and verification of digital systems in a structured manner and at different levels of abstraction. These languages not only facilitate communication among designers but also enable smooth interaction between computer-aided design (CAD) tools and the digital models themselves (Terés et al., 1998).

HDL-based development environments integrate compilation, simulation, and synthesis tools, allowing the functional behavior of a design to be validated before its physical implementation. Today, the most widely used HDL languages are VHDL and Verilog, both standardized by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and broadly adopted in the digital design industry.

\textbf{VHDL: Description, Application, and Structure}

VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language) was originally developed to document and verify high-speed integrated circuits within the VHSIC program of the U.S. Department of Defense. Its syntax and semantics are based on the ADA programming language, providing a robust structure suitable for critical and real-time systems.

VHDL allows modeling a digital system at different levels of description: behavioral, register-transfer level (RTL), and structural logic level. This enables coverage of nearly the entire digital development cycle, from functional specifications to prototype generation, excluding only the physical layout.

The correct choice of abstraction level in the description depends on the design objective. For instance, if the goal is to generate a physical implementation using synthesis tools, the RTL level is preferred. In contrast, to validate the functionality of complex algorithms through simulation, the algorithmic level is more appropriate (Baena, 2010).


\subsection{Comparison between Hardware Description Languages and Software Development}

Since their inception, various computer-aided design (CAD) tools and environments have employed specific languages and formats to represent and manage the diverse elements involved in electronic design. Some of these languages consisted of explicit notations used by the designer to describe inputs to particular tools, while others corresponded to internal intermediate formats, optimized for automated processing within the CAD environment and generally hidden from the designer.

However, these descriptions were limited to the particular ecosystem of each tool, offering neither portability nor standardization. The emergence of Hardware Description Languages (HDL) represented a significant advance by introducing a higher degree of standardization and incorporating principles from software engineering into the specification and modeling of digital hardware.

From a syntactic perspective, HDLs share similarities with high-level programming languages (HLL), which facilitates their learning for engineers with prior software development experience. For example, Verilog shares many features with the C language, whereas VHDL inherits its structure and semantics from the ADA language. While these similarities can accelerate HDL adoption, they can also lead to conceptual errors if software-oriented strategies are applied in contexts where an accurate representation of the hardware's physical behavior is required.

It is essential that, when an HDL model is intended for synthesis and physical implementation (e.g., on FPGAs or ASICs), the designer adopts a hardware-oriented mindset, describing the logic using a structural or register-transfer level (RTL) approach rather than merely an algorithmic one. Conversely, employing software-like structures can be appropriate when the goal is solely functional simulation of the system, optimizing performance during verification and timing analysis stages.

In summary, HDLs are high-level formal languages specifically designed to represent electronic circuits at various levels of abstraction—from basic logic gates to complete digital systems—and allow flexible, structured, and precise hardware modeling, leveraging concepts from both electronic design and software development, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:imagen1}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth, height=6cm]{imagenes/img1}
\caption{Abstraction/precision levels and VHDL modeling styles.}
\label{fig:imagen1}
\end{figure}

HDLs were initially developed to model the functional behavior of electronic components, enabling simulation prior to physical implementation. Nevertheless, they are also widely used for the structural description of digital circuits, facilitating subsequent synthesis and verification through validated simulation processes (Figure \ref{fig:imagen2}).

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth, height=6cm]{imagenes/img2}
\caption{Software versus hardware development: (a) abstraction levels and high-level languages, and (b) basic top-down design scheme using HDL.}
\label{fig:imagen2}
\end{figure}

Building on the initial descriptions, top-down design approaches allow progressive synthesis processes that gradually lead to more detailed implementation levels, ultimately achieving a specific, technology-dependent physical description. Validation at each stage of the design is performed through functional simulations and analyses, enabling successive verification and correction iterations until the behavior conforms to the specified requirements (Figure \ref{fig:imagen2}(b)).

The DE2-115 incorporates essential interfaces for developing interactive systems, including USB ports, Gigabit Ethernet, VGA output, audio input/output, and a set of integrated user I/O devices such as switches, buttons, LEDs, and seven-segment displays. Additionally, it features a 50 MHz crystal oscillator and expansion connectors compatible with additional modules.

This platform is widely used in academic laboratories and applied research environments due to its compatibility with development tools such as Quartus Prime, facilitating the implementation of designs in HDL languages like VHDL and SystemVerilog. Its capability to perform simulation, verification, and synthesis of designs within a single tool makes it ideal for higher education projects in electronic engineering, mechatronics, and digital systems Figure \ref{fig:imagen3}.

\subsection{Formatting of Mathematical Components}

This is the example 1 of equation:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation}
a = 1,
\end{equation}
\end{linenomath}
the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please punctuate equations as regular text.
%% If the documentclass option "submit" is chosen, please insert a blank line before and after any math environment (equation and eqnarray environments). This ensures correct linenumbering. The blank line should be removed when the documentclass option is changed to "accept" because the text following an equation should not be a new paragraph.

This is the example 2 of equation:
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\begin{adjustwidth}{-\extralength}{0cm}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.
\begin{equation}
a = b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i + j + k + l + m + n + o + p + q + r + s + t + u + v + w + x + y + z
\end{equation}
%\isPreprints{}{% This command is only used for ``preprints''.
\end{adjustwidth}
%} % If the paper is ``preprints'', please uncomment this parenthesis.

%% Example of a page in landscape format (with table and table footnote).
%\startlandscape

\end{Theorem}

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

%% Example of a proof:
\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem 1]
